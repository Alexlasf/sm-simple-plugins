//		How to edit this file:
//		"admin_colors"										<--	Leave this alone
//		{																	<--	Add all groups/steamids after first bracket (Leave this alone)
//																			
//			"STEAM_0:1:1234567"							<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//			{
//				"flag"			""								<--	This is the flag(s) assoicated with the group.  This field doesn't matter if the group name is a steamid
//				"tag"				""								<--	This is the text for the tag (tag only appears in processed chat)
//				"tagcolor"	""								<--	This is the color for the tag (tag only appears in processed chat)
//				"namecolor"	"{teamcolor}"			<--	This is the color for the name
//				"textcolor"	"{default}"				<--	This is the color of the text
//			}
//
//			"groupname"											<--	This can either be a steamid for a specific player, or a group name
//			{																<--	Open the group
//				"flag"			"z"								<--	This is the flag(s) assoicated with the group.  This field doesn't matter if the group name is a steamid
//				"tag"				"[admin]"					<--	This is the text for the tag (tag only appears in processed chat)
//				"tagcolor"	"{green}"					<--	This is the color for the tag (tag only appears in processed chat)
//				"namecolor"	"{green}"					<--	This is the color for the name
//				"textcolor"	"{default}"				<--	This is the color of the text
//			}																<--	Close the group
//
//			"everyone"											<--	A groupname of "everyone" will work for all players (always place LAST)
//			{
//				"flag"			""								<--	Leave this blank for "everyone" group
//				"tag"				""								<--	Leave this blank for "everyone" group; unless you want to "tag" everyone
//				"tagcolor"	""								<--	Leave this blank for "everyone" group; unless you want to "tag" everyone
//				"namecolor"	"{teamcolor}"			<--	This is the color for the name
//				"textcolor"	"{olive}"					<--	This is the color of the text
//			}
//		}																	<--	Add all groups/steamids before last bracket (Leave this alone)
//
//		NOTE:
//		If you don't enter a steamid, "everyone", or "overrides", then the group name does not matter, it's just for your reference.
//		There is NO POINT in using name: {teamcolor} text: {default}.  You are just making the plugin work for nothing.
//		DO NOT INTERCEPT CHAT FOR NO REASON
//		Valid colors are (not for every mod: see link below):
//		"{default}"
//		"{green}"
//		"{lightgreen}"
//		"{red}"
//		"{blue}"
//		"{olive}"
//		"{teamcolor}"
//
//		--------YOU CANNOT USE THE FOLLOWING TOGETHER--------
//		"{lightgreen}"
//		"{red}"
//		"{blue}"
//		"{teamcolor}"
//
//		These colors are considered team colors and you cannot use more than 1 team color at a time.
//		For a better understanding of what these colors mean, how they work, and on what games, see this link:
//		http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=96831
//		Thanks to exvel for the great .inc file!
//
//		--------ORDER OF OPERATIONS--------
//		
//		The order in which you place items in the config file matters.  Here is what determins what color they get:
//		1. SteamID
//			If there is a steamid present, it will always override everything.  If you put a steamid in twice
//			then the first entry (top to bottom) will be used. (I think, just don't do it!)
//		2. Groups
//			The plugin will search (top to bottom) for a postitive match for the flag string.  The player' flags
//			will be compared with the group flag string, and if the player has all the flags, it will stop there.
//			For example. Admins with the "ad" flags and donators with the "a" flag.  If you place the "a" flag group
//			above the "d" group then the admin will get the "a" colors. Order matters.  
//			You can use more than 1 flag for the group. You could have made the admin group with the "ad" flag,
//			but it will always take the first match.
//		3. "everyone" Group
//			This should ALWAYS be the last item in the config, and should ONLY be used if you actually change the color.
//			Don't use it if you put name: {teamcolor} text: {default}.  You would be intercepting chat for no reason.
//			DO NOT INTERCEPT CHAT FOR NO REASON
//
//		--------OVERRIDES GROUP--------
//
//		This group is not required in the config file.  If present, the words listed will cause the chat system
//		to bug out and not process the chat message.  These are single words, and the chat message entered by the player
//		needs to match the word listed; the entire message.  For instance, lets enter these overrides:
//
//		"Overrides"
//		{
//			"rank"				""
//			"testcommand"	""
//			"rtv"					""
//			"nominate"		""
//		}
//
//		Using the above overrides, lets look at the following chat messages:
//
//		Player: rank							<- This message will NOT be proccessed
//		Player: ranked						<- This message will be proccessed
//		Player: what is my rank		<- This message will be proccessed
//
//		ONLY 1 WORD MESSAGES THAT MATCH THE WORD IN THE OVERRIDES SECTION WILL WORK
//
//		---------DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE---------
